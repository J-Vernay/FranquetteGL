# FranquetteGL Documentation {#mainpage}

FranquetteGL aims to be a usable implementation of OpenGL, done in software
(as opposed to hardware graphic cards). Goals include, in order of priority:

- Being educational on the inner workings of an OpenGL implementation
- Well-documented readable code which can be used to reason about OpenGL
- Large-scale project organization
- Standard C with emphasis on inspectability and modularity
- Sufficiently performant for real-time graphics

This documentation includes both information for the inner workings of FranquetteGL,
and for the implemented EGL/OpenGL/ES functions and types.
